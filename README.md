# Polynomial-Linear-Regression

Advantages of using Polynomial Regression:

Polynomial provides the best approximation of the relationship between the dependent and independent variable.
A Broad range of function can be fit under it.
Polynomial basically fits a wide range of curvature.

Disadvantages of using Polynomial Regression

The presence of one or two outliers in the data can seriously affect the results of the nonlinear analysis.
These are too sensitive to the outliers.
In addition, there are unfortunately fewer model validation tools for the detection of outliers in nonlinear regression than there are for linear regression.
